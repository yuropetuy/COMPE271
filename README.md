## COMPE271

This course was dedicated to learning computer architecture, specifically how programming works from a low level perspective.

This course was broken up into 2 projects, one is a C project dedicated to building the general logic of a program of our own choosing.

The main project is the same program written in MIPS Assembly. The program I chose was a game simulating driving on a highway while obstacles randomly spawn from the top and come down to you. There was a heath system included that allowed the player to collide with up to as many items as there were health points.
